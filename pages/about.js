        Add some more text to this later. I started training some 20 years ago
        and after an initial trial month I fell in love with training.{' '}

            My mission is to give you the power of a personal trainer. You
            accomplish this by creating your own database of different variable
            like, sleep, recovery, intensity and nutrition. And with those
            variables, you should be able to know why you are/not progressing
            with your training. This way you can adjust accordingly and set new
            goals that help you get there.
